// Generic (SAE J2012) OBD-II diagnostic trouble codes — the P0xxx codes standardized
// across all OBD-II-compliant vehicles regardless of manufacturer. This is deliberately
// NOT exhaustive and deliberately excludes manufacturer-specific codes (P1xxx and most
// codes above P0999): those definitions vary by make and sometimes by model year, and a
// wrong manufacturer-specific definition is worse than no definition at all. This exists
// to give the AI diagnosis a verified ground truth for common codes instead of relying
// purely on model recall, which is what was producing wrong answers before.
